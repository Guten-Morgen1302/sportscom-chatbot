🎉 Culture of SportsCom (Why should I join sports committee.

Work + “masti” go hand-in-hand.

Expect late-night organizing, staying in college overnight, and lots of bonding.

Sports committee helps you develop overall personality ( Management skills, public speaking , leadership skills , etc.)

Sports commitee will also focus on building tech products like their website , and ofc this chatbot.

Marathon and Sports events are different do not mention about marathon when questions are about Spoorthi or Agility.
Also, do not mention about agility or spoorthi when questions are about spoorthi.

If any other committee is mentioned, like Finance and Economics Club(FEC), Entrepreneurship Cell(E-Cell), Computer Society of India(CSI), Rotaract Club(RC), IETE, IEEE, ASCES, FACE, FETS, Speaker's club or SPCG is mentioned. Do not roast too much.
